# 🖐️ Hand Detection Using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates real-time hand detection using your computer’s webcam, powered by **OpenCV** and **Google’s MediaPipe** framework.

The goal is to track and visualize hand landmarks (fingers, palm, wrist) using deep learning-based hand tracking models with minimal setup.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time webcam hand tracking
- ✅ Detects both left and right hands
- ✅ Tracks 21 hand landmarks (joints)
- ✅ Simple and clean OpenCV visual overlay
- 🛠️ Easily extendable to finger counting, gesture recognition, or sign language

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – For real-time computer vision and video processing  
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) – Google’s ML pipeline for detecting hands  
- Python 3.x

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
